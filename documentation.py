    """### Introduction
The human heart is a muscular organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients to tissues, and removing carbon dioxide and other wastes. It's a central component of the circulatory system and plays a crucial role in maintaining life.""")

st.image("heart.jpg", width=400)
"""### How the Heart Works
The heart functions as a dual pump, managing two main circulatory routes: pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation."""

("""**Pulmonary Circulation:**
The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where it receives oxygen and expels carbon dioxide.

**Systemic Circulation:** The left side of the heart pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body, supplying tissues and organs with the oxygen needed for energy production.
Each heartbeat is part of a cycle that includes:

**Diastole:** The heart muscle relaxes, allowing the chambers to fill with blood.Blood flows into the atria from the veins (right atrium from the body, left atrium from the lungs).  

**Systole:** The heart muscle contracts, pushing blood out of the chambers to the lungs and the rest of the body.""")  
("""### Types of Heart Disease""")
st.write(" ***Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):***") 
("""The most common type, characterized by the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.""")  
  
st.write(" ***Heart Attacks:***")  
("Occur when the plaque rupture causes a blockage, resulting in myocardial infarction (death of heart tissue).")
